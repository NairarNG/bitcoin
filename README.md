What is Nairar?
----------------

Nairar is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Nairar uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Nairar Core is the name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of the Nairar Core software, see http://nairar.com

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/nairar-project/nairar/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Nairar Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The developer [mailing list](https://amsarku.com
should be used to discuss complicated or controversial changes before working
on a patch set.

Developer IRC can be found on Freenode at #nairar-core-dev.
